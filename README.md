# Linkachiever
A World of Warcraft Retail achievement link tool


### What Linkachiever does? It show a list that covers YOU as a person, and not the specific character.
Players can view and share their achievements in-game by going to the "Achievements" tab on the character menu and selecting the specific achievement they want to share. They can then use the "Link" button to generate a link to the achievement which they can then share with others.
